# Resume Vigo Vlugt
Welcome to the source code of my resume.  
The resume is entirely written declaratively using React components.  
To render the resume to a PDF, the @react-pdf/renderer library is used.  
Using Vite, we can start a development server to preview the resume in the browser and see changes in real-time.  
Thanks for reading!
